Tracking developmental changes in model-based reinforcement learning: an online replication study.

We collected data from 151 participants on two tasks: the two-step task, as described in Decker et al. (2016)
and the Matrix Reasoning Item Bank (MaRs-IB) as described in Chierchia et al. (2019). 

Both tasks are publicly available on Pavlovia. The two-step task can be accessed [here](https://pavlovia.org/hartleylabnyu/space-task) 
and the MaRS-IB task can be accessed [here](https://pavlovia.org/hartleylabnyu/mars)

The R scripts and Matlab modeling code reproduce all analyses reported in the manuscript.
